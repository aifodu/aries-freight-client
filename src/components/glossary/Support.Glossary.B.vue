        <p><strong>BAF (Bunker Adjustment Factor) or BSC (Bunker Surcharge) - </strong> Surcharge
            assessed by carrier to freight rates to supplement increased fuel costs.</p>
        <p><strong>Bank Guarantee - </strong> Document accepted in lieu of original bill of lading to
            release cargo. Protected in writing to carrier for performing a deviation from normal
            business, guaranteed by a bank.</p>
        <p><strong>BB (Break Bulk) - </strong> A term used to describe cargo which does not constitute a
            full container, or which is palletized, boxed, etc., or large machinery, trucks, etc. Also
            used to describe cargo, which cannot be containerized due to its size and/or nature.</p>
        <p><strong>B/L (Bill of Lading) - </strong> A receipt for the cargo and a contract for
            transportation between a shipper and the ocean carrier. It may also be used as an instrument
            of ownership, which can be bought, sold or traded while the goods are in transit. To be used
            in this manner, it must be a negotiable "Order Bill of Lading".</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>"Clean B/L"</span> is issued when the shipment is received in good order. If
                damage or a
                shortage is noted, a clean bill of lading will not be issued.
            </li>
            <li><span>"On Board B/L"</span> certifies that the cargo has been placed aboard the named
                vessel and is
                signed by the master of the vessel or his representative. On letter of credit
                transactions, an On Board B/L is usually necessary for the shipper to obtain payment
                from the bank. When all bills of lading are processed, a "ships manifest" is prepared by
                the steamship line. This summarizes all cargo aboard the vessel by port of loading and
                discharge.
            </li>
            <li><span>"Inland Bill of Lading"</span> is also known as the "Waybill" on rail or the "Pro
                Forma B/L" in
                trucking. It's used to document the transportation of the goods between the port and the
                point of origin or destination. It should contain information, such as marks, numbers,
                steamship line, etc., to match with a dock receipt.
            </li>
        </ul>
